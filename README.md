# Phishing-URLS-Emails-Detection
## Phishing URL & Spam Email Detector
This project provides a robust solution for detecting malicious URLs and identifying spam emails. Leveraging machine learning models and comprehensive feature engineering, it offers a proactive defense against prevalent cyber threats. The application is built with a user-friendly web interface using Flask, making it accessible for real-time analysis.

## üöÄ Features
### Dual-Threat Detection: 
Identifies both phishing URLs and spam emails within a single application.
### Machine Learning Powered: 
Utilizes trained models (Gradient Boosting Classifier for URLs and Multinomial Naive Bayes for emails) for accurate threat assessment.
### Extensive URL Feature Extraction: 
Employs a sophisticated FeatureExtraction module to analyze various URL characteristics (e.g., IP address presence, URL length, use of symbols, redirection, domain registration length, HTTPS status, favicon, non-standard ports, and more) to determine legitimacy.
### Email Spam Classification: 
Processes email content using a CountVectorizer and a trained model to classify emails as "Ham" (safe) or "Spam".
### Intuitive Web Interface: 
A Flask-based web application provides a simple and interactive platform for users to input URLs or email content and receive instant predictions.
### Confidence Scores: 
For URL detections, the application provides a confidence score, indicating the probability of a website being safe or a phishing attempt.
### Clear Visual Feedback: 
Displays distinct messages and interactive buttons  based on the detection result, enhancing user experience and awareness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### URL Phishing Detection

The URL detection module analyzes various features extracted from a given URL to classify it as legitimate or phishing. The `FeatureExtraction` class meticulously extracts over 20 features, including:

* Presence of IP address in the URL
* Length of the URL
* Usage of URL shortening services
* Presence of `@` symbol in the URL
* Redirection count
* Prefix/Suffix in the domain
* Number of subdomains
* HTTPS usage and certificate validity
* Domain registration length
* Favicon characteristics
* Non-standard port usage
* Request URL, Anchor URL, and Links in Script Tags analysis
* Server Form Handler and Information Email presence
* Abnormal URL characteristics
* Website forwarding behavior
* Status bar customization and disabling right-click
* Pop-up window usage and iframe redirection
* Age of domain and DNS recording
* Website traffic, PageRank, and Google Index status
* Links pointing to the page and statistical reports

These features are fed into a pre-trained Gradient Boosting Classifier model (`url_detection.pkl`), which outputs a prediction and confidence score. The `url_phishing.ipynb` notebook details the training and evaluation process for this model using the `phishing.csv` dataset.

### Email Spam Detection

The email spam detection component processes the text content of an email. It uses a `CountVectorizer` (`vectorizer.pkl`) to transform the text into numerical features, which are then input into a pre-trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model (`email_detection.pkl`). This model classifies the email as either "Ham" (safe) or "Spam." The `email_phishing.ipynb` notebook outlines the data preprocessing, model training (including handling class imbalance with SMOTE), and evaluation for this spam detection model using the `emails.csv` dataset.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1.Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

### 2.Create a virtual environment :
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3.Install the required libraries:
The project dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4.Ensure models and vectorizer are available:
1.The app.py expects url_detection.pkl, email_detection.pkl, and vectorizer.pkl files to be present in the same directory. 
2.These files are generated by running the Jupyter notebooks (url_phishing.ipynb and email_phishing.ipynb).
3.Run these notebooks to train the models and save them.

### 5.Run the Flask application:
python app.py
The application will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
